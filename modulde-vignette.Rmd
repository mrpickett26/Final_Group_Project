## R Markdown

[1] provides background on the statistical method/topic/data visualization procedure that you have chosen to explore and [2] takes a user through one or more examples of the application of the approach with a real dataset. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
